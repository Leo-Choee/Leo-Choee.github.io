Welcome! I’m Leo Choee, an engineer based in South Korea.
This blog, Dirty-Hand, takes its name from the well-known developer mantra: “Make your hands dirty!” — a reminder to dive into the code and learn by doing.

Here, I share my journey and insights into artificial intelligence (AI) development and research.
If you’re curious, have questions, or want to spark a discussion, feel free to reach out.
I hope you find something useful and inspiring in my posts!
